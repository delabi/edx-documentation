Overview
**********

EdX awards certificates for individual courses that have a verified track and
for edX programs, including XSeries programs. Most certificates are web
certificates that you can save or print.

Transcripts are not available for edX course work.

.. note::
    Some edX courses offer academic credit. These courses have different
    requirements and steps for earning certificates. For more information, see
    :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit Index`.

.. _SFD Certificate Types:

****************************
Certificate Types
****************************

EdX currently offers two types of certificates: a verified certificate for a
single course, or an XSeries certificate for a series of courses. Not all
courses offer certificates.

.. note::

  In the past, edX also offered free honor code certificates. These
  certificates are no longer available for most new courses. If you earned an
  honor code certificate in a previous course, you still have access to your
  certificate through your dashboard.

  For more information, see `News About edX Certificates`_.

.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

======================
Verified Certificates
======================

A verified certificate shows not only that you successfully completed your edX
course, but also that you verified your identity by using a webcam and an
official government-issued photo ID from your country or region.

Verified certificates include the following information.

* Your name.
* The name of the course.
* The edX partner institution that created the course.
* The names and signatures of one or more members of the course team.
* The date (UTC) when the certificate was issued.
* A URL that others can visit to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

.. note::
  The name on the certificate is the full name that appears on your dashboard.
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is
  correct. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Basic Information`.

Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course or the
number of credit hours that the course might earn at a university.

For more information about enrolling in a course and working toward a verified
certificate, see :ref:`SFD Verified Track`.

For more information about the benefits of verified certificates, and to see an
example of a verified certificate, see `Verified Certificates`_.

For a list of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course
catalog`_.

.. _SFD XSeries Certificates:

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you have successfully earned a verified
certificate for each course in a series of courses that make up an XSeries
program. An XSeries program can have from three to ten individual courses.

XSeries certificates include the following information.

* Your name.
* The name of the XSeries program.
* The edX partner institution that created the XSeries program.
* The names and signatures of one or more members of the XSeries team.
* The month and year when the certificate was issued.
* A certificate ID that others can use to validate the certificate.

For more information about XSeries programs, see `XSeries Programs`_.

For a list of all courses that are part of an XSeries program, see the `edX
course catalog`_.

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed automatically after a course or XSeries ends. You
do not have to complete any additional steps to receive your certificate.

==========================================
Receive a Certificate for a Typical Course
==========================================

Most courses distribute certificates within two weeks after the course ends.

When your certificate is ready, a link to your certificate is visible on your
dashboard, along with your final grade.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_web.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: Dashboard with course name, grade, and link to the web certificate.

Select **View Certificate** to open the certificate in your browser. You can
then share and print the certificate. For more information, see :ref:`SFD
Sharing and Printing a Certificate`.

.. note::
  Beginning in XX, edX courses have issued web certificates. Prior to XX, edX
  courses issued PDF certificates. Links to PDF certificates are also visible
  on your dashboard, next to your final grade. To view a PDF certificate,
  select **Download Certificate (PDF)**. You can then save or print your
  certificate.

If your certificate is not yet ready, you see the following message under the
course name on your dashboard.

::

  Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
  will be available shortly.

Additionally, you see the following status message on the **Progress** page in
your course.

::

  We're working on it...

  We're creating your certificate. You can keep working in your courses and a
  link to it will appear here and on your Dashboard when it is ready.

=============================================
Receive a Certificate for a Self-Paced Course
=============================================

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through them at your
own pace.

Most self-paced courses offer edX-generated certificates. A few self-paced
courses offer on-demand certificates.

EdX-Generated Certificates
**************************

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you have completed all course
requirements, a certificate is generated automatically. You do not have to
complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others
issue certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
specific certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Home** page
for your course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates:

On-Demand Certificates
**********************

Some self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to request and download your certificate as soon as you complete
enough of the course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out
if a course offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

::

  Congratulations, you've qualified for a certificate!

  You can keep working toward a higher grade in the course, or request your
  certificate now.

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate.

.. Caution::
 The grade that you see on your dashboard reflects your grade at that time you
 requested the certificate. If you complete more assignments to raise your
 grade, the grade on your **Progress** page changes, but the grade listed on
 your dashboard is not updated.

.. _Request Download Certificate:

Request and Download an On-Demand Certificate
=============================================

To receive and download your certificate at any time after you qualify, follow
these steps.

#. On the course **Progress** page, select **Request Certificate**.

   After you request your certificate, the certificate creation process may
   take up to 48 hours. When your certificate is ready, a "Your certificate is
   available" message appears on your **Progress** page.

#. Download your certificate from the **Progress** page or from your dashboard.

   * To download your certificate from the **Progress** page, select
     **Download Your Certificate** in the upper right corner of the page.

   * To download your certificate from your dashboard, select **Download Your
     Certificate** next to the name of your course.

==============================
Receive an XSeries Certificate
==============================

Learners receive XSeries certificates automatically when they earn verified
certificates in all the individual courses in an XSeries program. XSeries
certificates are distributed immediately after the learner receives the
verified certificate for the final course.

XSeries certificates are visible on the **Programs** tab on the learner
dashboard. The list of XSeries certificates that you have earned is in the
right pane.

For more information about XSeries programs, see `XSeries Programs`_.
